Project developed in Bepid - (Brazilian Education Program for iOS Development) at SENAC-SP.

Overview
======

Development of a breathanalyzer with arduino, interfacing with iOS using FSK-Frequency-shift keying communication. The app communicate with arduino for data aquisition

Development of a breathalyzer with arduino interfaced with iOS communication using FSK - Frequency-Shift Keying. The application communicates with arduino for data acquisition and have integration with social networking features to the user (Facebook). Also provided is a system of maps with points of interest pre-defined (taxis, bus stop).

The inteface was developed in portuguese, and as a way to further integration with the user, the title of app, was made in the style of the character Mussum. If you are not a portuguese speaker, search about your job [from here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussum).
